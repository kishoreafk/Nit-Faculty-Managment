# Proof Upload Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified
The uploaded proof files were not being displayed in both admin and faculty pages because:
1. Files were being uploaded to the filesystem correctly
2. But the database was not always storing the correct file paths
3. Some uploads were working (product bill images) while others weren't (leave proof files, product images)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Multer Configuration
- Updated path construction in both `leave.routes.js` and `product.routes.js`
- Changed from relative paths to absolute paths using `path.join(__dirname, '..', 'uploads', folderName)`

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging
- Added comprehensive logging to both leave and product controllers
- Added console logs to track file upload process
- Added debugging information for troubleshooting

### 3. Database Structure Verified
- Confirmed that required columns exist:
  - `product_requests`: `product_image_url`, `bill_image_url`
  - `leave_requests`: `proofFile`, `proofFileName`

## Files Modified
1. `backend/routes/leave.routes.js` - Fixed multer path construction
2. `backend/routes/product.routes.js` - Fixed multer path construction  
3. `backend/controllers/leave.controller.js` - Added logging and error handling
4. `backend/controllers/product.controller.js` - Added logging and error handling

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server
1. Stop the current backend server (Ctrl+C)
2. Navigate to the backend directory
3. Run: `node server.js` or use the provided `restart-and-test.bat`

### Step 2: Test Leave Upload
1. Go to Leave Management page
2. Click "Apply Leave"
3. Fill the form and attach a proof document
4. Submit the form
5. Check backend console for logs showing file upload process
6. Verify the proof appears in the leave list

### Step 3: Test Product Upload
1. Go to Product Request page
2. Click "New Request"
3. Fill the form and attach product image and/or bill image
4. Submit the form
5. Check backend console for logs showing file upload process
6. Verify the images appear in the product request list

### Step 4: Verify Admin View
1. Login as admin
2. Check AdminDashboard user details modal
3. Verify that proof files are visible and clickable
4. Test that file links open correctly

## Expected Console Output
When files are uploaded successfully, you should see logs like:
```
Apply leave request received:
Body: { leaveType: 'Sick Leave', startDate: '2025-01-02', endDate: '2025-01-03', reason: 'Medical appointment' }
File: { fieldname: 'proofFile', originalname: 'medical_certificate.pdf', ... }
Leave proof file uploaded: /uploads/kishore_s/proofFile-1754075000000-123456789.pdf
Leave request inserted with ID: 7
Proof file saved to DB: /uploads/kishore_s/proofFile-1754075000000-123456789.pdf
```

## Troubleshooting

### If files still don't appear:
1. Check backend console logs for error messages
2. Verify uploads directory exists and has correct permissions
3. Check database entries using: `node test-proof-data.js`
4. Ensure frontend is sending files correctly (check browser network tab)

### If uploads fail:
1. Check file size (must be under 10MB)
2. Check file type (PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG allowed)
3. Verify user authentication is working
4. Check multer error messages in console

## File Serving
Files are served via Express static middleware:
- URL pattern: `http://localhost:5000/uploads/username/filename`
- Physical path: `backend/uploads/username/filename`

## Next Steps
1. Test the fix thoroughly
2. Monitor console logs during testing
3. If issues persist, check the specific error messages in logs
4. Consider adding frontend error handling for better user experience
